Diffusion-Augmented Vision Transformer(ViT):
Artificial data scarcity has been applied to the covid dataset to reduce to only 323. A baseline ViT using the dataset has been evaluated. 2 Diffusion Model denoised via DDPM has been built, one without attention mechanism, one with attention mechanism.
The 2 diffusers are trained with the 323 Covid x-ray images so that they can generate artificial yet realistic covid-19 x-ray data to make the total dataset 523 for covid class.
Separate 2 ViT are trained with the new dataset one with the images generated by attention-less diffuser another one by attention-included diffuser.
Result shows impoove in recall and F1 score relative to the baseline ViT for both Diffusion-Augmented ViT however the recall of the ViT with attention-less diffuser generated images performs slightly better.

Pneumonia X-Ray RAG agent:
A RAG agent that takes an xray image and diagnoses the causes (normal, bacterial-pneumonia, viral-pneumonia, covid) via a Diffusion-Augmented Vision Transformer (ViT)..
Contains 5 nodes: ViT node, Reasoner 1 node, Retriever node, Reasoner 2 node, Explainer node
ViT node: classify the xray with the ViT model
Reasoner 1 node: Formulate the query to be sent to the Retriver node based on the ViT result and confidence
Retriever node: RAG retriever capable of taking the query from the Reasoner 1 node to search the 3 most similar/compatible documents
Reasoner 2 node: Evaluate the compatibility of the documents to the ViT result, if the ViT result confidence score is low or the documents retrieved are deemed insufficient, an advise on the next query is written and is flow is back to the Reasoner 1 node. If sufficient, the flow moves to explainer node
Explainer node: Professionally evaluate and diagnose the ViT result based on the documents retrieved and refined. Output node.

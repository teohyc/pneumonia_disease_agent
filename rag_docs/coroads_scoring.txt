Co-RADS:

Category 1:
Negative or very low
Normal chest X-ray • No abnormality detected

Category 2: 
Negative or very low
Minor abnormalities unrelated to COVID-19 pneumonia
• Anatomical variants (e.g., breast
implants, scoliosis, and old bony
fractures)
• Features favoring minor technical
issues (e.g., suboptimal inspiration,
inadequate exposure) but not
affecting film interpretation
• Irrelevant abnormalities (e.g., old
tuberculosis (TB), mild cardiomegaly,
aortic atherosclerosis)

Category C: 
Low 
Low probability or atypical for COVID-19 pneumonia, but with other clinically significant diseases requiring clinical correlation and further management
• Other clinically signifcant diseases
(e.g., bacterial pneumonia, active
TB, congestive heart failure,
pneumothorax, pleural effusion,
malignancy)
• Presence of severe technical artifacts
affecting film interpretation
and requiring a repeated or followup chest X-ray

Category 3: 
Moderate 
Equivocal/unsure/indeterminate for COVID-19 pneumonia
• Some features (e.g., subtle, poorly
dfined opacities) that may represent
early/mild/atypical COVID-19
pneumonia or other causes (e.g.,
pseudolesions, other diseases)
requiring clinical correlation and
follow-up chest X-ray

Category 4: 
High 
Suspicious for early/mild COVID-19 pneumonia
• Single or multifocal poorly defined
ground-glass opacities or
consolidations in the unilateral lung

Category 5: 
Very high 
Typical for COVID-19 pneumonia
• Multifocal peripheral opacities
(ground-glass opacities and/or
consolidations), including those
with rounded morphology, in
bilateral lungs

When chest X-ray findings at more than one category, the chest X-ray should be
designated with the higher Co-RADS category [28]. For example, a chest
X-ray shows subtle equivocal opacities in one lung (Co-RADS category
3) and multifocal, poorly defined ground-glass opacities in another lung (Rama
Co-RADS 4), the chest X-ray should be assigned to Co-RADS category 4.
When another clinically signficant disease coincides with a single poorly defined
ground-glass opacity or consolidation, the chest X-ray should be assigned to
Co-RADS category 4 (Figure 2B).
standardized description and interpretation of Co-RADS facilitate
radiologists to provide a rapid, precise, and concise chest X-ray report regarding
the presence or absence of pneumonia in patients with confirmed COVID-19,
despite the different levels of experiences.
